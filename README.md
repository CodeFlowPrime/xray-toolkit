## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. ⚡ Browser-Based IP Scanner
Scan CDN IP addresses directly from your browser without using external tools or servers.
- **CDN Providers:** Cloudflare, Arvancloud, Gcore, Fastly, or Custom CIDR ranges.
- **IP Range Checklist:** Dynamically select/deselect specific predefined IP ranges to target scans on preferred ranges.
- **Port Scanner:** Support for major HTTPS/HTTP ports (443, 8443, 2053, 2083, 2096, 80, 8080).
- **Anti-Censorship Filters:** Configurable minimum latency thresholds to filter out fake firewall resets (TCP RSTs).
- **Advanced 3-Phase Network Scanner (Discovery, Validation, Deep Scan):** Dynamically handles dynamic CIDR ranges of any size (from `/32` to `/8`) with mathematical capacity determination, applies Fair Subnet Sampling with budget redistribution to explore subnets, adaptively allocates resources based on quality scores (proportional + exploration pools), filters false-positive ISP resets, and performs a deep latency/stability scan on the top candidate IPs.
- **Multi-Test Stability Scan:** Perform multiple connection checks (1, 2, or 3 times) per IP to ensure zero packet loss and report average latencies.
- **Live Logging Console:** Watch the real-time breakdown of tested ranges and responses directly in the scanner console.
- **High Performance:** Multi-threaded architecture ($O(1)$ lookup matching) capable of generating and scanning up to **50,000** IP candidates instantly.
- **Live Metrics:** Real-time progress bar, latency display, and sortable results.
- **Exporting Options:** Copy working IPs (bulk or individual click-to-copy), download as text file, or export directly to the Config Generator.

### 2. 🛠️ Bulk Config Generator / Modifier
Modify or generate hundreds of V2Ray/Xray configs in bulk using clean IP addresses.
- **Protocols Supported:** VLESS, VMESS, Trojan, and WireGuard.
- **Flexible Naming Styles:** Rename your configs dynamically (keep original, fixed custom prefix, sequential numeric suffixes, or random suffixes).
- **Input Methods:**
  - **IP Ranges (CIDR):** Generate configs sequentially from CIDR blocks.
  - **IP List:** Merge a base configuration with a list of clean IP endpoints.
  - **Config List:** Extract IPs from existing configs and merge them into a base configuration.
  - **SNI Spoof Mode:** Fast local SNI spoofing adjustments.
- **Easy Export:** Copy all generated configs or download them as a `.txt` file with one click.

### 3. 🎨 Premium UI/UX Design
- **Cosmic Space Background:** Dynamic drifting nebulae and starfield canvas animation.
- **Flexible Customization:** 4 accent colors (Rose, Blue, Emerald, Purple) and a fully unified Light/Dark mode switcher.
- **Offline Persistence:** Uses an offline-first caching mechanism using local storage, saving your preferences and configuration states.
